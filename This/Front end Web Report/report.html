    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I approached my website by thinking about what I wanted to be on display on my website. I looked at multiple portfolios to see how i would like my portfolio to be viewed in the future. I decided on making a website that looked as professional as possible with minimalist events occuring so it wasn't to flashy but enough so that it can be adhere to the proper portfolio and emphasising on my key strengths and work.My website will portray me to be a hard-working individual who is professional but also athletic and quite versatile in numerous fields of work with substantial experience behind me.In terms of determining the content of what i wanted in my website i took inspirations from other portfolio websites and used them as a guiding tool to portray me as a person. I wanted the home page to have a model image displaying a model of me with a simple message and links at the bottom. The about me page would describe as a person, what my goals are and the things i would like to achieve and my hobbies. The Resume page would mainly consist of the substantial amounts of work Experience i have participated in and  what my goals are. The skills page would have all the projects i have participated in and the code i have done and finally a simple contact page at the end to finish the website of. </p>

    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>The target audience my portfolio is targeted at will be software engineering mainly for bionics so robotic engineering.This is mainly due to the advanced robotic images i planned to have on my website in order to attract their attention.The first portfplio I looked at was one designed by a korean software engineer. http://www.kaiwa-projects.com/ . The website intrigued as it was incredibly professional and simple with single page of the website getting straight to the point of showcasing the users skills. The nav bar was incredibly smooth and transitioned nicely , the website had a nice display of colour and suave to it and seemed to fit everything that was happening in the scenes. Though simplistic the technical skills page showed the skills the user had learn efficiently  highlighting his strongest points of work. The website was responsive as well and this nudged me into the idea of creating a similar website like this. The next page i looked at was som work given by brittany cheng. https://brittanychiang.com/ Her work was delightful to view as it was incredibly versatile she had transitioning images on each point of her website almost simulating the movie the matrix and her website was responsive and diverse with the use of animations such as loading the website via a sort of diamond icon and the portrayal of images journeying through her life and the events that she had done. Th choice of fonts were great and everything was mainly accessible. I decided to try to use images as much as possible to display my works instead of words. The last portfolio i looked at was a piece of work by Dan French https://danfrench.net/?gclid=CjwKCAiAi_D_BRApEiwASslbJw_pUNWaKrLGeDJJ9G-tDmUvuaIWA4EmhJpxxThM_-VxWiR9C2seYhoCuOcQAvD_BwE I appreciated the simplicity of his portfolio and his responsiveness however there wasnt much to capture the eye. I used a youtube video as a tutorial to prepare on creating this piece of work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgRENOnSCxE the main concepts was what was needed in a website was there so i tried to implement his skills as possible. I also used stackoverflow W3Schools and bootStrap

    <h1>Planning</h1>
    <p>I manually made my website accessible by sifting through code and ensuring that werent any errors in my code i.e making the html tags were correct and appropriate. I ensured the class containers were called correctly without any spelling erros within the code to ensure each class had its own appropriate css signature. I ensured the color were matching in the appropriate places, the nav bar was both responsive and carried out its duty such as actually directing users to the appropriate pages when clicked and the color on it is mainly within the range of visual sights of all people. The fonts of the words are pleasant to the eye and bold enough to be seen by everyone. The use of images will help with any users with difficulty reading it as the images mainly protray the portfolio. The simplistic view and color scheme of the website allows for the user to casually enjoy scrolling through the website as there are very little distractions but enough interactivity via images and icons to simulate interest in the work. </p>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>I had learn how to create a navbar first and formost when creating the website ensuring the navbar was both attractive, acted as a button for each page but also making sure it was responsive and collapsable when the page was minimised. I mainly used youtube tutorial to create the navigation bar and modified the code to suit my needs example the placement of it and how long and wide i wanted it to be.using w3 schools table i measured and played around with the code to find suitable mesurements for the nav bar position properties. I continued to use the same method to create each individual part of the website and develop it constantly modifying each part until they fit the oerfect positions. When the home page was done i used it as a template to create the other pages. In terms of the words i used fontawesome and google fonts to make sure the choice of fonts for the words were an excellent choice for work. I also had a java script file to help with the folding and unfolding of the nav bar. Finally i used a youtube tutorial to learn how to make my work responsive using at media queries i had no idea how to perform such an act so i had to see what to implement at the various screen sizes that allows for responsiveness all across the board. Then the rest was just applying the same method across the other pages until the task was completed. I used font awesome to use some image icons. </p>

    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <p>The nav bar of my code worked particularly well across every single page it is responsive across screen sizes each of the links work accordingly and the color is consistent across all pages. The same goes for the responsiveness of the pages as a whole in terms of how organised everything is in terms of buttons pictores fonts and there is no degradation i can see so far. The consistency of the website and the overall layout looks solid and visually aesthetic to the eye. I wish i was able to implement things so as picture rolls within the projects section and adding more interactive elements like futuristic animations and transistions if i had more time i would definetly look into creating a page using that was more animation reliant with some gliding effects.   </p>
