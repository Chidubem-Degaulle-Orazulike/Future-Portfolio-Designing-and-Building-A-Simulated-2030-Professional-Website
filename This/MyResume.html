      <p class = "text">I aim to become a Software Engineer. My reasons for wanting to become an engineer are because I have a keen interest in technology and the physics behind how they work and with my ideas I strive to create new technology. For me, Computer Science is a way of expressing my creativity and aptitude for logical and critical thinking. As a child maths was a subject that I understood due to my ability to think abstractly and Computer Science was the next stage in further honing my ability. Both the mathematical complexities, coding, and information always grant me a sense of fulfilment and bliss every time I delve into the subject.</p>

          <p class = "text">I was granted the pleasure of working in McDonalds. Working there granted me multiple skills such as communication, teamwork, leadership, confidence in my abilities, working in a fast paced environment and best of all striving under pressure. Upon being accepted for the job the skills I have acquired will help me understand the harshness of workplaces and will help me rise to the challenge no matter what it is and most importantly of all communicate to people of all ages and races with kindness, patience and diligence.</p>

          <p class = "text">I also attended the University of Bristol summer school. This further helped
              cement my determination in choosing computer science. As I was thoroughly fascinated during
              the multiple taster sessions where I learnt about how to code a Seismometer that plotted a
              seismograph using the data it obtains which was achieved by using an accelerometer, a
              processor and the coding language Arduino.
